I have to write a new api to able to edit user profiles. upon first login we check if user details are abailable
on their corresponding table like foodrunner in foodrunner table, if not we redirect them to fill the user details
they can update these anytime in the future.

Daily reports api is yet to be writened.

Extra Ingredients should be added into the orders api itself but a separate file to create update delte extra ingredients.
